                <p>
                    My name is Jacob I Missry. I go to George Washington University of business with a major in Business Administration and a concentration in Entrepreneurship. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, and one of 3 in my family.

                    I can say, Covid was a big struggle for me as it was tough for me to be isolated at my home, and this put me in the position to adapt to a new environment that I’d never seen before. Although it was difficult, it allowed me to test out new hobbies and find new interests for myself with all the time I had on my hand. After trial and error, I concluded to love the fashion industry, not just the clothing and designing, but all aspects of the business side. So, in April 2020, my clothing company was born by the name of, Not Just Jeans. We started by marketing aggressively on social media and pushing products online. Once life started getting normal, I had the opportunity to open a retail store through July and august in Soho, NYC, and this helped us establish a brand name and establish a larger platform. Now I’m back in school to get my education but also balance the business. All and all, I’m a very hard and persistent worker and perfectionist. I overcame many obstacles throughout my life, which taught me not to slow down when something goes wrong but to find the silver lining and push through; this will lead you to success.
